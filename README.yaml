description: |-
  Terraform module to deploy the resources to use S3 for remote Terraform state storage. A DynamoDB table is created to
  enable state locking.
  
  ![Architecture diagram](./docs/terraform-aws-s3-terraform-backend.png)

  **WARNING:** There is an assumption in this module that you'll be deploying the state backend to an AWS account that
  you're then also going to deploy infrastructure to and you're likely logged in with an administrator account.
  No permissions or IAM roles are configured for accessing the state bucket other than via administrator access. If
  you are consolidating your Terraform state across projects into a single AWS account then you'd probably want to
  use per-project IAM roles for accessing and modifying state.
usage: |-
  The following example creates the backend:
  
  ```hcl
  module "backend" {
    source    = "sr2c/s3-terraform-backend/aws"
    # version   = "x.x.x"
    namespace = "eg"
    name      = "backend"
    stage     = "dev"
  }
  ```
